# History of the game:
In a class at school we were learning Python 3 computer language. I decided to go a little a-head and learn Python 3 and Pygame (graphics and stuff) to make a little extra credit assignment. Six years later I picked up the old code and decided to spruce up the game a little. I added menu sounds, frame rate control, improved the AI, physics, etc. among other small improvements. I decided I would attempt to make the game multiplayer as a learning experiance, which is where the game currently stands (on the Multiplayer branch). It is quite an old project of mine, developed around the same time as White - Storm: Lightning (alpha) and was my first python project so please forgive the code quality! I use it for fun and to learn about multiplayer programming amongst other things once in a while.
